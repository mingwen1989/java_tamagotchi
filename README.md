# Java Tamagotchi

#### By _Ming Wen_

## Description

In the early 2000's, Tamagotchis were all the rage. They were handheld, digital pets that could be carried around on keychain-sized mini computers. They required loving care by pressing buttons to feed them, play with them, and put them to sleep. If you didn't give a Tamagotchi enough food, attention or rest, it would...alas...die.
This is an app written in Spark that simulates a handheld Tamagotchi. You can check on your pet, feed it, play with it, or put it to sleep. Be careful! Too much attention, food, or sleep may adversely affect your pet's health!
